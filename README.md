## SDUI Lab
Hi there, I'm Kevin I'm here to share with you how can I learn Server Driven UI 

Before we get started let me tell you about the reason my team make deccison learn Server Driven UI

 we run into problems when delivering new feature for apps on AppStore, it will take several time  for Apple review the code and improve it on AppStore,Tester team also put alot of effort to test that feature 
Unfortunately, my team wants our product to deliver to customers fast as we can 



## Server Driven Component 

SDU means the server will decide which component will show in the client how many items is displayed on the screen instead of client decide 


The client must define how many component is drawn on screen,the component format is fixed
Server will provide the component type for the client show which component from object's server   

## Customize basic attributes 

we can customize atrtributes for each element eg bold, padding/ margin, alighnment etc, we can hide the element if not needed 
The server will not provide an exact size 
# Customize the position of basic
